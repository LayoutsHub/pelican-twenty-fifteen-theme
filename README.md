### Article Page Tags

When creating an article page in the **Twenty Fifteen Pelican Theme**, you need to include specific metadata at the top of each page to ensure it displays correctly and is optimized for SEO. Here’s a breakdown of the required tags and how they work:

```markdown
---
title: What is Lorem Ipsum?  
summary: Summary of the post  
featured_image: https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C  
category: ispum  
slug: what-is-loreum-ispum  
date: 14/09/2024  
robots: index, follow  
status: published  
---
```

### Explanation of Tags:

1. **`title`**:  
   The title of your article. This will be displayed as the heading on the page and in search results.
   - Example: `title: What is Lorem Ipsum?`

2. **`summary`**:  
   A brief summary of the post, which is often shown in post listings and previews. This gives readers a quick overview of the content.
   - Example: `summary: Summary of the post`

3. **`featured_image`**:  
   A URL to the image that will be featured with your post. This is often displayed at the top of the article or in previews.
   - Example: `featured_image: https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C`

4. **`category`**:  
   The category that this article belongs to. This helps organize content and makes it easier for readers to find related posts.
   - Example: `category: ispum`

5. **`slug`**:  
   The part of the URL that uniquely identifies the article. It is automatically generated from the title, but you can specify it manually. This should be in lowercase with hyphens instead of spaces.
   - Example: `slug: what-is-loreum-ispum`

6. **`date`**:  
   The publication date of the post. Format this as `DD/MM/YYYY`.
   - Example: `date: 14/09/2024`

7. **`robots`**:  
   This tag tells search engines whether they should index and follow the post. Use `index, follow` to allow search engines to list the post, or `noindex, nofollow` if you don’t want the post to be indexed.
   - Example: `robots: index, follow`

8. **`status`**:  
   The status of the post. Use `published` to make the post live, or `draft` to keep it hidden until it's ready.
   - Example: `status: published`


By including these tags at the top of each article, you can easily manage the post’s title, summary, featured image, author information, and SEO settings.

### Static Pages Tags

For static pages like "About" in the **Twenty Fifteen Pelican Theme**, you need to include specific metadata to ensure these pages display properly and are optimized for search engines. Here’s how you should structure the metadata for static pages:

```markdown
---
title: About  
slug: about  
summary: This is my about us page  
featured_image: https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C  
robots: index, follow  
status: published  
---
```

### Explanation of Tags:

1. **`title`**:  
   The title of the static page, which will appear as the heading of the page and in the browser tab.
   - Example: `title: About`

2. **`slug`**:  
   The unique part of the URL for the page. It helps to define where this page will be accessible. For an "About" page, the slug is usually simple, like `/about`.
   - Example: `slug: about`

3. **`summary`**:  
   A short description or summary of the static page. This can be useful for previews or post listings.
   - Example: `summary: This is my about us page`

4. **`featured_image`**:  
   A URL to the image that will be featured on the page. This can enhance the page visually or help with SEO.
   - Example: `featured_image: https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C`

5. **`robots`**:  
   This tag tells search engines whether they should index the page and follow links on it. Use `index, follow` to allow search engines to list the page, or `noindex, nofollow` if you want to exclude it from search results.
   - Example: `robots: index, follow`

6. **`status`**:  
   Indicates the publication status of the page. Use `published` to make the page live, or `draft` to keep it hidden until you’re ready.
   - Example: `status: published`


By including these tags, you ensure that your static pages, like "About," are organized, indexed by search engines, and easy to manage in Pelican.
